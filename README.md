![Preview Image](docs/preview.png)


## Getting started

Create a `.npmrc` file in the repository root with the following contents:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
@danielfoord:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

You should then be able to run `npm install` with no issues.
## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
